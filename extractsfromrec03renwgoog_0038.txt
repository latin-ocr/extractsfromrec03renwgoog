of Paisley was held, and that Paisley was visited at the time by
some heroic figures. The murder of the Red Comyn before the
high altar in the Ohurch of the Franciecan Friars in Dumfries
lay heavy upon the conscience of the Bruce. It is said that
be was absolved by Wishart, the Bishop of Glasgow‚ before he
assumed the crown, but not satisfied with thie, he desired the

assurance of forgiveness from the Pope, and sent messengers to
⁵ obtain it. One of the messengers, it has been conjectured,
though probably cn insufficient grounds was the Steward3 but
whether he was or not, in the year mentioned Cardinal Beren-
garius, according ιο ιιι document cited by Fordun, acting with
the authority of Pope Clement V.‚ issued a Οοιιιιιιίιιὶοιι1 ιο Walter
Abbot of Paisley to absolve “Robert de Bruce, layman of Oarrick,''
and his accomplicerr, and ιο appoint them penances proper for their

crime. lf the penitential ceremony took place, it would in all
probability be performed in the Abbey Ohurch, whose walls, still

black with the lires lighted by the English, would lend an addi-
tional effect ιο ιιι soene.

¹Gocdall, Fordun, ii. 231. 'l'he followingis Dr. Loes’ translation oi this interesting
document (Paisisy Abbey, 95) :—“ Berengsrius, by Divine merny Osrdinsl Presbyter, by

A petition presented ιο ιιι by s certain noble, Rohert de Bruce, layman ol Oarriclr in the
said diocese, stated Tlrat he letely, with certain accomplices, being inspired by the Deril,
slew John and Rnhert Comyn, knights, who provolred him very much, in the church oi

grest striies and ιιι parile of war, ιιι not able to go ιο the Apostolic Sast, or even his own
discessu or his vicar, he humhly urade supplicetion that hs and his accomplices might be
merciiully dealt with by that Scat. We, therefore, who rejoice to suoconr the faithful in
Christ, hythe authority oi the Lord Pope, whose penitentiary we are, and, indeed, ere

communication which they have incurred ior this thing, and from the charge oi slaying
