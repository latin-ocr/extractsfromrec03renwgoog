the right 01 ohoosing the Provost, Bailies, 'l’own Oounoillors, and
other offioers 01 the Burgh is given to the Abbot and his suo-
oessors, who if they deam it expedient may remove any 01 them
during their term 01 office, and appoint others in their plaoe
without any other 01001100 01 the burgesses or eommunity. Itis
spooially provided, too, that the rights and privileges are to be
the same and to be enjoyed under the same conditione as those 01
the burghs of Dunfermline, Newburgh, and Arbroath.¹

This oharter oould not, of oourse, oome into operation all at
onoe. The formal sanction 01 the Abbot and Oonvent was
required ; permission had to be obtained from the Pope to 100 the
land, and several other preliminaries had 10 be arranged. Doubt-
less the Abbot had long had the matter before him, and for some
time had been preparing for it. As early as 1483 he had
applied to the Pope for permission 10 100 the Monastery lands,²
and doubtless his arrangement with Renfrew respecting the
boundarieS, in 1488, was part of the same purpose.⁸ The Pope
referred the question 01 feuing 10 two commissionem—John
Oriohton, Preoentor 01 Glasgow Cathedral, and Walter Aber-
nethy, Provost 01 the Collegiate Ohuroh of Dumbarton—whom he
authorised, in the event 01 their being satisfied that it would be to
the advantage 01 the Monastery, to grant the desired permission.
The Oommissioners met within the Abbey on the loth November,
1488, about three months aster the charter had been obtained, and

deoided in ternis 01 the request⁴ When the King earne to the
Abbey in J uly, 1489, Abbot Shaw would be busy making the
arrangements necessary for giving 011001 10 the Obsrter 01 Erec-
tion, and on the 2nd 01 J uly, 1490, 1ιο issued his Charter by wbioh
Paisley became a free Burgh 01 Barony.⁵
