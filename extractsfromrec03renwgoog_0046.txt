the charters were the Abbot's men. These were men who,

the Convent in the peaceable enjoyment of its possessione. First,
he took the Abbot and monins, their men, and all their posses·
sions under his own firm peace and protection, so that any hurt
or injury done to them became an act done against the Orown.

without delay, the just debts they owed to them.

the King took the extraordinary step of addressing a letter to
the Benedictine monasterias and to those of the Augustine Order,
which seem to have been in a similar case, exhorting them “ in
