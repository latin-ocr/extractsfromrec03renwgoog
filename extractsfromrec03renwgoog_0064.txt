quartar of beyf takyn for a penny of oustume, ane oabok of oheyss
takyn for a half-penny of austum, and a wynde of quhitolaith for
a penny of oustum.”¹ This time, however, the Abbot’s bailias,
Alan Stewart and John Whiteford‚ were on the alert, and
gathering their men, they foroibly re-took the poinded goods,
and the men of Renfrew were obliged to return to Renfrew
empty-handed. Thus worsted, the Bailies and burgenses of
Renfrew raised an aetion against Stewart and Whiteford, the
Abbot’s bailias, before the Iords Auditus, for defrauding the
King of his eustoms‚ usurping the privileges of their burgh, and
taking from their “ custumars and officiens ’' the goods they hed
poinded for their oustoms in the town of Paisley.² The case was
postponed from time to time, but on the 13th June, 1493, judg·
ment was delivered in favour of the Abbot’s Bailies, and against
the Bailies and burgesses of RenfreW‚ on the ground that the town
and lande of Paisley hed been ereoted into a free barony and
regality at a date preoeding the infestment made to the town of
RenfreW, and that the town of Renfrew was privileged only
within the town of Renfrew and the barony thereos, and was not
entitled to levy toll and oustom within the town and regality of
Paisley. On the nand of the same month the finding of the Lords
Auditors was oonfirmed by the King.⁸

The victory he had thus obtained Abbot Shaw resolved to
follow up. In 1494 he raised an action against the Bailies and
burgesses of RenfreW‚ in which he sued thern for the damage done
in eonnection with the market erosa during the midnight raid
upon the new burgh.⁴ Subsequently the scope of the aotion was
enlarged, and aooording to the summons issued, rand December,
1495, he sued them for the tolle and oustoms they had levied
within the regality of Paisley during the past hundred years, for
the expense he had been put to in oonneotion with the late action,
