xlvi. THE BURGH OF PAlSLEY.

took in hand the careful management of the Abbey lands, kept an
excellent Rental-Book,¹ and got his way with Lawmund of Law-
mund, a pugnacious Highland chief who had given the Abbey

much trouble, in connection with the church of Kilfinan in Argyll-
shira² Like his predecessore, Abbot Orichton satin Parliament,
and was often employed in affairs of State. The roof of the Abbey
Ohurch, which Abbot Tervas had only “ theekit with sclats,” he
covered with lead brought from the Oastle of Bute‚ and given for
the purpose by the King. Another token he received of the
King's favour was his promotion to be Abbot of Dumfermline in
1473.

This event, together with the King's appointment of his suc·
cessor to Paisley, caused a great stir throughout the kingdom.
Legally the appointment of Abbots was in the hands of their own
Houses‚ and their election by them had always been jealously,
though often ineffectually, guarded. In October, 1462, an Act had
been passed hythe Scottish Parliament declaring any nomination
to an Abbey or a Cathedral, even by the Pope, invalid, and assert-
ing the right of the monks and clergy to elect their own dignitaries.⁸
By the appointment of these two Abbots, the King was himself the
first to violate the Act. Fortunately for Paisley, this arbitrary and
sslf-contradictory act on the partos the Crown turned out to its
great advantage. The individua] appointed was not even a Bene·
diutine. He was a parish priest, George Schaw, Rector of the
Ohurch of Minto, in Roxburghshire. A man of learning, sound
sense, and great ability, he did honour to his appointment, and
proved himself the most illustrious of the Abbots of Paisley. His
father was Hereditary Keeper of Stirling Oastle, and played a
prominent partin the politius of the time. Shaw himself, im-
mediately aiter his appointment to the Abbey‚ was entrusted by
J ames ΙΙΙ. with the education of his seoond son, the Duke of Rosa,
