the Stewards, obtained permission to construet oratoriee or private
chapels in their courts for celebreting divine service for their

of the hospital built by Robert croc, apparently on the west
eide of the Levern, between old Orookston and Neiloton, to
have a chaplain. The Mother Ohureh was to suffer no loeo
