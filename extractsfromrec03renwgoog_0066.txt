other ⁸monastic churches the Abbey Church at Paisley‚ with the
Ι exception of the cheir, which here, as elsewhere in similar cases,
was reserved for the nronks, was used as a parochial church. In

it werealtars dedicated to Our Lsdy, St. Peter, St. J ames, St.

Ninian, St. Nicholas St. Anne, and St. Katherine. All of them
were endowed, and each of them had its own priest or chaplain.
During Abbot George's lule, J ames Crnwfurd of Kylwynat,l a
burgess of Paisley‚ and his wife, Elimbeth Oalhraith, devoted the
savings of their industry to the building of St. Mirin’s Ohapel,
for a long time known as the Sounding Aisle, and to the erection

and on the 15th of July‚ 1499, they executed a deed whereby
they founded and endowed the elnrplaincy of the Altar.‘² By
this time the beautiful chapel was probably finished. Aa any rate
it was finished by the fourteenth of August in the following year, for

ten o’clock in the morning, within the Town House or Tolbooth of
the Burgh, to the Badies, Allan Stewart and Stephen Wess, as
patrone. J aures Crawfurd and his wife were present ; so also were
