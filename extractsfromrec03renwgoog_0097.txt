xciv. THE BURGH OF PAlSLEY.

Oatholic, when the scandal so increased, that the Archbishop was
no longer able to screen her. The Earl was included in the same
condemnation as his mother, and the proceedings against them and
their servants dragged on slowly and bitterly. On the aoth
January, 1628, the Countess was excommunicated.¹ The Earl
fled the country. The Oountess sought refuge in Edinburgh.
There she was apprehended and cast into the Tolbooth. Her im-
prisonment caused her to suffer from “many heavy diseases, so
that this whole winter she was almost tied to her bed, and she now
found a daily decay and weakness in her person.’' For six months
more she was confined in the Oannongate J ail. At last in March,
1631, aster being some three years under restraint, she was per-
mitted to go to Paisley “ for the outred of some weighty affairs,''
on condition that while there she should not “ reset Thomas Algeo
nor no J esuits, and return by a certain day, under penalty of five
thousand merks.''² The poor lady never returned. She reached
Paisley utterly broken down, suffering from squalor carceris, and

l, died shortly aster her arrival, the victim of an odious persecution,
as cruel in its spirit as that of the Netherlands and Spain.

The process against the Earl, her son, though dropped for a

time, was, on his return to the country, immediately revived.

His wife also was proceeded against. The Assembly took in hand

lto superintend the education of their children. As late as the

year 1647, the Commission of the General Assembly was still

“dealing '’ with the Earl, and on the 8th July in that year it
directed the Presbytery of Edinburgh to confer with him as long
as he remained in Edinburgh, and “ if he go to his house in the
countrie ’' it recommended the Presbytery ol Paisley to confer with
him there³

The Earl was present at the annual election in Paisley, ath
October, 1630, when, according to custom, he chose one of the
Bailies, the other being ohosen by the Town Oouncil.
