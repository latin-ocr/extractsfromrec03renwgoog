they dealt with cases of Sabbath desecration and non-attendance
at prayers, preachings and communion, with cases of fornication
and adultery, and with other offences formerly dealt with by the
Ohurch.

The punishments they inflicted were fines (unlaws), imprison-¹
ment, confinement in the stocks and jougs, carting through the
town, branding with a hot iron, banishment, confiscation of goods,
forfaiture of holdings. The fines, as need hardly be said, were in
Scots money. In cases of impriscnment in the Tolbooth, offenders
were at first given the key and told to go and incarcerate them·
salves. Later it was found necessary to give them in charge to
the officer with instructions to lock them up and to make him
responsible for their safe custody. Carting, branding, and banish-
ment were apparently reserved for great or incorrigible offenders,
most of whom, singularly enough, appear to have been women.
Offences of the lighter sort were sometimes purged by a slight fine
or by a public confession. At times the fine was dispensed with,
when public confession of guilt and request made on bended knees
for pardon from the individual offended were deemed a sufficient

punishment. One punishment, because of its tremendous effect,

was seldom inflicted, via, the “ crying down '² of the freedom of a

all his privileges in the burgh and became practically an outlaW.

The rule of the Bailies and Town Oouncil was paternal‚ care-
ful, and prudent, and appears to have given general satisfaction.
The few complaints that were made against them were evidently l
ebullitione of temper rather than well-founded or deliberate ’ l
charges, and were invariably withdrawu when challenged. In ¹
matters of religion the Bailies and Council acted according to ²
their lights. Their public spirit was unquestionable, and they
laboured diligently and successfully in the defence and enlargemeut
of the liberties of the burgh.
