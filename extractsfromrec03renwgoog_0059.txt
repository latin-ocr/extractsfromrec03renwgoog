liv. THE BURGH 01² PAISLEY.

The Charton it will be observed, defines the boundaries of the
burgh, lets cortun lands to the Provost, Bailies, burgesses, and
community, assigns common lands for common pastura, grants the
right ol winning psat, stone, and ocal, recites the privileges and
liberties enumerated in the King's Charter, defines the govem·
ment of the Burgh, also in terms of the King's Charter, prescribes
the oaths to be taken by burgesses and stallingers, vin, to the
King‚ to the Stewards of Sootland, and to the Abbot and Convent,
and requires all the inhabitants of the burgh to carry what grain
they have for grinding to the mill of the Monastery, and to no
other. The Abbot and Convent obviously dealt as liberally with
their new burgh as was in their power.

The 2nd of J uly, 1490, was unquestionably a great day lor
Paisley‚ the greatest, indeed, in its history. But it would be a
mistake to suppose that because the Town hod been erected into
a burgh by a Royal Obarter, it had been placed in the front rank
of the burghs of Sootland, or that its burgesses were put in
possession of all the rights and privileges that were then possible
tc burgesses in Scotland. It was not a royal burgh, and between
a burgh of barony, which was all that Paisley was made, and a
royal burgh, there was a considerable difference. Royal burghs
were represented in Parliament and in the Convention cf Royal
Burghs; burghs of barony, as a rule, were not. Burgesses in a
royal burgh held of the King‚ and were the King’s men; the
burgesses of Paisley were tenants of the Monastery, and were
the Abbot’s men. Possession of a borrowage in a King’s burgh
and residence upon it for a year and a day, unchallenged by his
lord or his lord’s bailiff, made a slave hee for ever; the possession
of a feu in a burgh of barony with residenoe upon it for any
length of time, had no such effect. In a royal burgh the bur·
gessae had the absolute right of electing their own provost and
