clerical assistance could be obtained from the Monastery, it may ³
safely be assumed that records were kept from the beginning.

As might be expected, no sooner had the inhabitants ol the
new burgh obtained permission to have a Market Oross than they
began to set about its erection. But they were soon to learn that
their enjoyment of the rights and privileges of which their
“ Merket Croce ” was the symbol, was not to be undisputed.
J ealous eyes were upon them. The burgesses of Renfrew, though
satisfied with respect to the marchas, lcoked upon the erection ol
Paisley into a burgh with feelings decidedly hostile. They re·
garded the erection as an encroachment upon their own rights and
privileges, For a hundred years, even though the lands of Paisley
had been erected into a regality, they had levied toll and custom
throughout the whole of the barony of Renfrew. Their right to
do so had never been challenged ; but the erection of the Market
Cross in Paisley was a distinct challenge of their right, and if
markets were allowed to be held around it, they would inevitably
prove injurious to the markets at Renfrew and deprive them of an
increasing amount of revenue.

All the Scottish burghs, whether royal or otherwise, were
intensely tenacious of their privileges, and were well known to
be extremely unwilling to admit any new aspirante into their
number. It was on this account, and probably in consequence

· of what was reported to him as being contemplated, or at any rate

in order to protect the new burgh from the jealousy of the
neighbouring burghs, that J ames IV., towards the end of the
year in which he hed granted the Oharter of Erection to Abbot
’ Shaw, issued a Precept under the Privy Seal,¹ warning the burghs
of Ayr, lrvine, Renfrew, Dumbarton, Rutherglen‚ and Glasgow,²

¹ 'I'he inclusion ol Gla-agor among the burghs is remarkable. It was itssll in perpetual
conflict with the royal burghs in the neighbourhood, and one would heve thought that it
st least would hare been friendly to the new burgh and in no need of the naming.
