sclander,'’ by removing him without any warrant 01 the Kirk “fra
his service and cuir ” in the Kirk of Paisley, wherein he was
placed with the consent 01 11ιο Kirk, by causing the Bailies of the
'l'own to displace him “fra teiching of thair scule,” and by laying
to his charge the crime 01 adultery with Margaret Ralston,
daughter of the Laird of ltalston, and using “ane extraordinar and
preposterous forme of proceiding '² to get his conviction. Knox
had induced the ministers of the Paisley Presbytery to raise an
action against Gilchrist before themselves for the crime of adultery,
“ quhairin thay pretend‚” says the petitiou, “ to proceid agains him,
and in the tryall thairof to use the depositionis and testimonie of

women-husies and bairdis.'' Moreover‚ Knox‚ it is alleged, is the ’

Ralston, has no suspicion 01 her having committed any such crime,
estsems her “ ane honest and faithful] wyf,'' will not concur in
“ ony sic persute agains her,'' and altogether dissents from it. It

until the crime should be justified before the J ustice.l

the Court in the Tolbooth, craving protection against Gawine

Stewart, a burgess of the Town, who was bound over to keep the .

peace and to leave the minister unmolested under a penalty of one
hundred pounds. Unfortunately‚ Stewart let fall some words
which so incensed Mr. Andro that he incontinently struck him on
the head with a key to the effusion of blood in the full presence of
the Court. For this, on the fourth of the month, he was suspended
,by the Ptesbytery. On the ninth he appeared before the Gourt of
