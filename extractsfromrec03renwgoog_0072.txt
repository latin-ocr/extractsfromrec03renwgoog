the verray poynt of utter ruyne. And these war the first fruictis
of the Abbot of Paisley.'’¹ This extravagance of language is itself
evidence that Knox felt that in Hamilton he had one whose
influcnce was great and to be feared. He admits as much. The
obedience given to Hamilton‚ he says, “was nothing inferiour to
that obedience that any King of Scotland of many yearis had
befoir him.” The English ambassador, Sadler, who was in con-
stant touch with the Refermer, bears similar evidence, frequently
mentioning him as the leader of the F rench party and as the '
trusted adviser of the Regent. “Ever since his brother, the Abbot
of Paisley, carne home,’' he writes in 1543, “he [the Regent] hath
been chiefly ruled and counselled by him, wh0, they assure me, is
altogether at the cast of Franoe, and the Oardinal’s great friend;
and whatsoever they do mind with the Governor to-day, the
Abbot of Paisley changeth him in the same to-morrow.”²

At Paisley, Hamilton entertained his brother, the Regent, on
more than one occasion. The Abbot was passionately fond of
building, but the only piece he is reported to have attempted at
the Monastery was unfortunate. At great expense he built a
tower to the Abbey Ohurch; but, the foundations being insecure,
it was hardly finished when it fell by its own weight³ The year'
aster his return, the Abbot was made Icrd High Treasurer of
Seotland,⁴ and in the following year his brother, the Regent,
acting for the Quaen, nominated him to the vacant See of Dun-
keld. His title to the See was contested by Robert Orichton,
Provost of St. Giles, Edinburgh, who produced an alledged decree ’
from the Pope, bearing that the promotion ef Hamilton was to be
conditional upon his own appointment to the See 161 Roas. An
