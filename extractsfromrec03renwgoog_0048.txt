The next year, 1445, Thomas de Tervas, a monk of Arbroath,
was appointed Abbot, and for fourteen years proved himself one of ·
the most capable and best Abbots the Monastery ever had. He
stood high in the favour of J ames 11, who, in 1451, granted him a
new charter of regality.¹ In this he confirmed the former charters
of regality, formed the whole landa of the monastery into a barony
to be called the Barony of Paisley, and in connection with the
regality in Dumbartonshire granted the four points of the
Crown, which had hitherto been reserved.² In the same year
he gave to the Abbot a charter of replegiation.⁸ This enabled
the Abbot of the Monastery‚ in the event of any of his tenants
or rentallers or men being indicted, attached, or arrested for
any crimes or transgressione in the royal courts of justice, to
demand that they should be given up to him to be tried before the
courts of the Monastery, which courts the Abbot was authorised
to hold, and also to levy fines and inflict punishments in them.
Itis expressly laid down, however, that the Oourts were to be
held at the close of the Chamberlain's Oourt, that the Chamberlain
or his deputy was to be summoned to assist as assessor, and that
the prisoners were to be tried hyan assize or jury of the King’s
burgesses. The fines levied the Abbot was authorised to retain
and use for the repair and restoration of the fabric of the Monas-
tery, “ because,'’ as the charter beare, “ of the great merits of the
said Thomas and of the reformation of the said Monastery made
by him.” For the same reasons, ,J ames gave to the Abbot another,
and as it seems in the present, a very curious and dubious privi-
lege—the privilege, namely, of holding in all time coming a
tavern and selling wine within the gates of the Monastery. At
the time, a tavern could nothe held and wine could not be sold
outside a burgh, except in a town or village that had a knight for
