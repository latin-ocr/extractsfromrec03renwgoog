xxxviii. THE BURGH OF PAISLEY.

the pretext that the churches of Kilkeran, Kilfinan, and Kiloolmanel
were in need of repairs, Iord Martin seized the ravenues which
Bishop Andrew had made over to the Convent for the supply
of their table and to help them in their adversity. Both sides

history of the Abbey. No great endowments like those which

Monastery and invaded its sacred precincts, breaking doors and
windows, striking the meu aud servants of the Abbey, and wound-

Monastery for at least fifty years. Under him the restoration of
the monastic buildings went on apace.³ A vigorous ruler, aud
