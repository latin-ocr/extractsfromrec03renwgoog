Robert, the son of Walter and Marjory, was the first of the
Stusrt Kings.

When the Abbot and Convent, after the defeat of Edward 11„
set themselves to restore the dilapidated fortunes of the Abbey,

and to reinstate it in its former prosperity, they met with much
sympathy. Abbot Walter had been succeeded by Abbot Boger,
and Abbot John had succeeded Abbot Boger shortly before the
death of the Bruce. In 1327, Brother Andrew, “Minister of
Argyll,'’ as he called himself, commiserating the common table
of the monks, and in answer to their earnest request‚ gave to
Abbot John and his brethren‚ with the consent of his chapter, the
rectorial tithes and dues of three churches in hie diocese, via,
Kilfinan, Kilkeran‚ and Kilcolmanel.1 About the same time the
Bishop of Glasgow, in consideration of the great damage which the
Monastery had sustained during the dreadful war (diram pererrem )
which had so long continued between the Kingdoms of England
and Scotland, confirmed and conceded to it the Church of Larga
and the chapel of Oumbrae, with all their dues, both great and

⁴ small. Hadid more. He relieved the monks from the charges

with which the gift had formerly been burdened,² his own sees
excepted‚ and allowed them to hold the Ohurch without pre-
senting a vicar, provided they served the Ohurch by priests placed
