agio vel forisfacto nisi pro eorundem pmprio debito, plegiagio‚ vel forisfacto3
Salvis burgis nostris; Firmiter inhibentes ne quis contra hanc concessionem
nostram ipsos vexare presumat injuste, super eandem nostram plenariam foris·
facturam. Mandamus insuper et firmiter precipimus justiciariis, vicecomiti-
bus, prepositis eteorum ballivis ad quos presentes littere pervenerint, ut omnes
illos in eorum balliis seu burgis qui debita debent predictis religiosis ad eadem
debita eis vel eorum certo actornato latori presentium juste et sine dilatione
reddenda, secundum quod idem religiosi vel dictus eorum actornatus dicta
debita sibi deberi ab eisdem rationabiliter probare poterunt vel poterit coram
eis, prout justum fuerit, compellant, ita quod pro eorundem defectu amplius
inde justam queremoniam non audiamus. In cujus rei testimonium has litteras
nostras predictis religiosis imperpetuum duraturas sibi lieri fecimus patentes;
