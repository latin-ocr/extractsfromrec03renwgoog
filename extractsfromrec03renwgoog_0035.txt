them and to state whether they had any objections to the proposed
change in the House at Paisley. They failed to appear, but sent
letters in which they stated that they had no objections. The
Commissioners, therefore, with reservation of the rights of othere,
decreed that the monks of Paisley might proceed to the election
of an Abbot¹ The High Steward gave his consent, but the Abbot
of Olugny had still to be rechoned with. When applied te, he
refused to concur in the finding of the Papal Commissioners, and
it was not till between the years 1243 and laea-probably in
1245-that Stephon, the Arch-Abbot, on the solicitation of a
number of Scottish bishops, gave his sanction to the change.
Nearly a hundred years had to elapse before the Abbot of Paisley
obtained the right to wear the mitre and the ring.

The first Abbot was probably William, though it is quite pos·
eible that the title was assumed by Roger‚ his predecessor, as the
Head of the House. William proved himself an energetic defendar
of the privileges and possessione of the Monastery. He resisted
with partial success the claim made by the Bishops of Glasgow and
St. Andrews to tax the ravenues of the churches belonging to the
Monastery and to exact from them certain dues in name of ‘⁴ pro-
curations,”² and repelled completely the attempt on the part of
Duffgal to wrest from the Abbey the lande which, in 1227, his
brother Maldowen, Earl of Lennorr, had bestowed upon it.³ Under
his energetic rule the prosperity of the Convent was thoroughly
established and consolidated. From the Pope he obtained several
Bulls which conferred special privileges upon tha House. These
privileges were afterwards extended and gave power to the Monas-
tery to hold its own against all who might seek to molest it.

The Abbey, and doubtless Paisley itself‚ shared in the pro·
sperity of the good times of Alexander III. At the battle 0f
Larga, Alexander the High Steward, who, like his ancestors, was a

liberal benefactor of the Monastery, was present, and, according to
