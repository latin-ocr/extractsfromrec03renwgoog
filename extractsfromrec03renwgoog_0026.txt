while the lands around them were brightened by the homes of
their retainers and brought under cultivation by the nativas, many

In Scotland the twellth century was an age of convent build-
ing. During the first half of it no fewer than twenty religious
houses ware founded Among them were some of the most mag-
nificent ecclesiastical monuments in the country. More than half
of tham owed their existence to David Ι. alone. He was the
founder of Jedburgh, Kelso, Melrose, Holyrood‚ N ewbattle, Gam-
buskennath, and others of less note. Several were built by his sub-
jects: as, for instance, Kilwinning and Dryburgh by Moreville, the
Constable3 and Dundrenuan, Tungland‚ aud Soulseat, by Pergus,
Iord of Galloway. Malcolm was by no means a “a sair sanct for
the croun,'’ like David, but he founded the Cistercian Abbey of ,
Oupar in Augus, a nunnery of the same Order at Manuel, in Lin-
lithgow, and a hospital for ‘⁴ pilgrims, travellers, and poor folk '·' ‚at
Soutra, on the borders of Lothian and Lauderdale. These great
examples Walter the Steward was not long in following. Lesa
than six years after he had received his charter from Malcolm, and
while on a visit with him to Fotheringay Castle¹ in N orthampton·
shira, ha executed the charter which laid the foundation of the l
Monastery of Paisley.¹ ⁸

According to this he undertook for the soul of King David,
etc, and to the honour of God to build a House of Religion
according to the Order of the monks of Olugny on his lands at ls
Paisley. He was to have thirteen monlrs³ from the Houae of
Weulock in Shropshire for the purpose of atarting his monastery,
the right of appointing the Prior was to be in his own hands and
iu the hands of his successore, and, except iu the general recogni-

ιἸἾιο place where Msry Quaen ol Secta, the most hspless ol his descendants, was
execnted.
