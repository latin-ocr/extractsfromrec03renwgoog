not long in coming against him.¹ The Archbishop escaped, hut
’ thirty of his supportare, who surrendered on condition that their
lives should be spared, were mercilessly hanged. soon alter, the

with other offences. His judges were Lord Ruthven, Lord
J ustice Olerk, and Mr. George Buchanan, Pensioner of Orosraguel.

April, 1571, “as the bell struck at six hours 11 even he was
hangit 11 the mercat crosa of Stirling upon the jebat.'' His body
was quartered, and some of his remains may have been carried 10

Langside on the side of the Queen, was also outlawed. Alter the
execution of the Archbishop, he led 1 wandering life. He was one
of the leaders who surprised Stirling on 4th September, 1571.
