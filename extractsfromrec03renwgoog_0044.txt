brother, gave for the glory of God, the Virgin, SS. Mirin and
J ames of Paisley, and for the monks there, the ten merk land of
Thornle, lying within the Barony of Renfrew and the Sheriffdom
of Lanark.’'¹ A few small endowments had been received shortly
before, but this ten merk land of Thornley, which closed the record,
was the richest that had been received for many years.

Neither Robert ΙΙ. nor Robert ΙΙΙ. conferred upon the House
with which their family was so closely identified, any considerable
endowments, probably for the sufficient reason that they had none
to give. But, if they did not show their favour towards it in this
way, they did in others. Bobert ΙΙ. frequently interposed in its
behalf, while his son and successor conferred upon it two charters
of great importance.

By the first he erected all the lands of the Monastery situated
in the counties of Renfrew, Ayr‚ Roxburgh, and Peebles into a free
barony of regality.² This was in 1396. Fisteen years before,
Robert ΙΙ. haddone the same for the lands of the Abbey in Dum-
bartonshire.³ The donation of regality was about the highest gift
the Sovereign could bestow upon a subject. Το adopt the lan·
guage of Oosmo Inuca, “it took as much out of the Orown as
the Sovereign could give. It was in fact, investing the grantes
in the sovereignty of the territory, and it raised up those for-
midable jurisdictione which too often set the Orown at defiance.”⁴
The only return that had to be made for the grant in this case
was the prayers of the monks and their successors in all time
coming for the King and his heirs. In the case of the Durn-
bartonshire regality, there was an annual charge of five chalders
of oatmeal for the watchmen of the Oastle of Dumbarton.⁵

Three classes of individuals are mentioned in the charter as
dwelling upon the lands of the Monastery—tenants (tenentes),
bondmen (bondi), and nativos and their followers (nativi et eorum
