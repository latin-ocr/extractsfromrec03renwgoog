of the endowment of the Grammar School. A chapel may also
have 'stood in the neighbourhood of what is now Lady Lana, and '
one dedicated to St. Nicholas was situated on the south side of
the SchoolWynd. Its site was subsequently occupied by the original
Grammar School. What happened to these chapels is not pre-

them, evidently in ruins, and it is not unlikely that they were

Neither the spoliation of their splendid Monastery nor the
dispersion of their kindly superiore, themonks, appears to have
made the people of Paisley in any way disposed to receive the new bs
Faith. John Knox preached in the neighbourhood, and paid a
visit to F inlaystone, but, so far as is known, hadid not visit Paisley,
Whenever 'the preachers of the new doctrine came to the

town they were coldly received, and the church doors were&
“ steyked '' against them. The Archbishop and a few of the
monks who still lingered about the Abbey treated the. new
order of things with contempt. Hamilton boldly heard confession '

of Sessionst then but recently established, and only escaped the
capital punishment they were liable to through the favour of the
Quaen. Three years later Hamilton baptized the Queen’s son,
J ames VI, with all the pomp of the ancient ritual. But though
