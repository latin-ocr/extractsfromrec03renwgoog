INTRODUCTION. xxxvii.

Edward Balliol was holding high court and festival in the Steward’s
castle at Renfrew. For twenty-three years the country had again
to endurc the miseries of war. The Steward, alter au attempt to
regain his Renfrewshire lands, took refuge in Bute. Thence hc
passed by night to Dumbarton Castle, where he collected what
forces he could, and, joined by Campbell of lochow, stormed
Dunoon Castle. Then crossing the (hyde, he regained for the
King Annandalc and the lower part of Olydesdale, Ounningham‚
Carrick, and Renfrcw, and though but twenty years of age,
was rewarded by being appointed joint-Regent of the Kingdom,
first with Randolph‚ and alter his capture by the English, with Sir
Andrew Moray. On the death cf the latter in 1338, he became
sole Regent. For three years hc ruled the country for David ΙΙ.,
and, in 1341, on the King's return from France, resigned his
office. At the unfortunate battle of Neville’s Crosa, though his
was the last division¹ of the Scottish army that remained intact,
with the exception of the King's‚ his enemies did not scruple to
say that he failed in his duty. During the King’s captivity he
was again Regent, and again honourably preserved the Kingdom.
After his return, the King, who accepted the statements of the
Stcward’s enemieS, and was not without feelings of jealousy
towards him, made several attempta to change the succession,
and in 1369 threw him and his son into Lochleven Oastle; but in
1370, in spite of the intrigues of his enemies, the Steward
ascended the throne as Robert ΙΙ.
