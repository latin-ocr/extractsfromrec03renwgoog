PREFACE.

Tus Charters and Documenta printed in this volume are all, I
believe, that are of essential importance for the history of the ’
Burgh of Paisley, down to the year 1665.
Among the documenta of special interest besides the twox
relating to the erection of the Town into a Burgh of Barony, are
the following, which have not been printed before: the Charter by gf
which Abbot Georgo Shaw conveyed to the newly erected Burgh
the Heyt House for use as a “ Common Tolbooth ; ‘’ the Ratifica·
tion by the Diffinitors of Olugny of the same Abbot’s 'endowment
of thirty orowus of gold to provide a Oommon Pittance for the
Menke, which endowment was with others transferred by
James VI. to the Grammar School; the Charter of James
Oraufurd founding the Chaplainry of SS. Mirin and Columba3

⁵ the Charter of the Grammar School; the Charter of 29th J uly,

1587, which reinstated Lord Claud Hamilton in the temporalities
of the Abbey and made him a Lord of Parliament; and the
Charter by which the Magistrates and Town Oouncil founded

and endowed an Hospital for six aged poor men.
Appendices ΙΙΙ., Ν, and V. have been printed before, but

with many inaccuracies.

The Extracts from the Town Council Records are brought μ
down to the year 1620. Had space permitted, many more of
equal interest might have been given3 and I am not without hope
