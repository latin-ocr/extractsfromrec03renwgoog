lxii. THE BURGH OF PAISLEY.

words—Orate pro eninm ejus.

In the meantime Abbot Georgo Shaw, though his name ap-
pears in J ames Crawfurd’s deed of endowment‚ had retired from
the abbacy. In 1495 King James IV. had appointed him Iord
High Treasurer of Scotland, but aster holding the office for two
years, he resigned it, and in the following year, 1498, being then
an old man and desirous of rest, he entered into an arrangement
whereby his nepheW, Robert Shaw, son of the (lovernor of Stirling
Castle, was appointed Abbot, while he himself retired to Blackston
by the banks of the Black Cart, one of the Abbey Granges. There
he spent the remaining seven years of his life, and was known as
“ the Pensioner of the Abbey.'' He was beyond question a wise
and prudent man, and the debt of gratitudo which Paisley owes to
him is great. '

Robert Shaw, who succeeded him, was, at the time of his
appointment, Viear of Monkton, but before his admission to the
Abbot’s stall, he became a member of the Cluniae Order, and
assumed the black habit a little before he assumed the mitre.

Like his predecessor, Abbot Robert had to resist the claims of
his diocesan. Roben, Archbishop of Glasgow, had for some reason
seized the fruits of several of the Abbey's charchas, and the rents
of some of its lands. He had also refused the monks “letters of
justice ” against certain individuale who were refusing to pay their
tithes, and had in other ways injuriously interfered with the
property of the brethren, and disregarded their rights as members

of the Order of Clugny. In his distress the Abbot appealed to
the Pope, and on llth August, 1500, his appeal was taken before
William Steward, Notary Public, in the Chapel of St. Mirin.¹
The result of this aymeal is not known ; but the probability is that
the decision was in favour os the Abbot, and that the privileges of
his Order were again upheld.
