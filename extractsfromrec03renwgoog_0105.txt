cii. Ι THE BURGH OF PAISLEY.

plained of. In most other towns of the time ruinous houses
were numerous.

The burgh, as delimited by Abbot Georgo Shaw, extended
from the east side of the bridge of Paisley upon the Water of Cart
along the High street, or the “ King's Highway,” to the vennel
opposite the Wellmeadow, at the head of Lady Lane, then north
by the ditch of the lands of Oalrshawside to Oakshaw W00d‚
where, turning east, the boundary ran along the ridge of Oakshaw
as far as Stoney Brae, “the passage to the Common,” where it
again turned north till it reached, at the foot of the brae, Snawdun
Burn‚ whence it ran to the Broom Dyke, and along that to the
Cart. On the south side, the boundary of the Burgh was the
Espedair to about the foot of South Campbell Street‚ thence to
Espedair street, along the west side of which it ran to St. Ninian's
Oross, which stood at the head of Oauseyside Street. The boun·
dary then ran west through St. Ninian's Orost to above the west
end of Whitefauld‚ then north to St. Mirin’s Burn, where it turned
west for some distance, and then ran north to the ditch of Oalr-
shawside. The burgh included also theold town in the Seedhill.

The Town had its ports or gates. The East or Brig Port
stood at the east end of the bridge; the West Port was between
what is now Ne. 34 on the south side of the High Street and No.
83 on the north side. The South Burn or St. Mirin’s Port, stood
at the foot of St. Mirin's Wynd. Opposite what is now No. 14
Mose Street stood the Mose Raw Port. In the Barn Yard or
School Wynd, probably at the head of Stoney Brae‚ was the Barn
Yard Port. The Town was not walled; but for its protection every

senar was required to protect his “ yard'’ with a strongly built ’

dyke on the side open to the country. There were houses beyond
the Porta or Gates, but these may be regarded as being in the
suburbs. The streets and localities mentioned down to the seven-
teenth century are the “ King’s Highway,” or High Street,
Wellmeadow, Brumelands, St. Mirin’s Vennel‚ Galsasyd‚ Longait,
which formed part of the present Oanal Street Daws Gait, the
Orchart‚ Orchard Yaird, the Common Passage or Kert Walk,
