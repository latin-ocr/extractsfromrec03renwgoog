of Parliament authorising them to levy tolle at the bridge for

, In 1601 occurs the first mention of leprosy in the burgh.² This,
however, was probably not its first appearance in the town. The

Recorde of the Town Council of a more dreadful scourge. This
was the plague. That thie was not the first appearance of the
plague in the Burgh is known from the Recorde of the Town

number is supposed to have fallen before it in 1361. It was
