xxxiv. THE BURGH OF PAISLEY.

On the 16th of J uly in the following year, J ames the Steward
died He was the staunch friend of Bruce, and, if the conjecture
alluded to above be correct, his powerful advocate with the Pope.
Like a number of his ancestors, he is said to have been buried in
the Monastery of Paisley, Seven years later, or two years aster
Bannockburn, his son Walter, who had distinguished himself in
that famous fight, buried his young wife Marjory, daughter of the
Bruce, and commonly known as “ Queen'Blear-Eye,'' in the same
place. According to tradition, her death was due to an accident she
met with while hunting at the Knock, a small rising ground mid·
way between Paisley and Renfrew. Until a few years age, the spot
upon which the accident is said to have occurred, was marked by
an octagonal stone column resting upon a solid pedestal‚ also eight·
sided, known as “ Queen Blearie’s Oross.” ln the Abbey, Walter
caused a “ faire monument '' to be erected to her memory. From
the Register we learn that he also caused prayers to be said for
the repose of her soul, and that inspired by love, and for the salva·
tion of his own soul and the soul of Marjory his wife, and for the
salvation of his ancestors and of all the faithful departed, he gave
to the Abbey of Paisley the Church of Largs, in Ayrshire‚ with all
its tithes and properties. The donation‚ however, was not to take
effect until the death or resignation of Sir William de Lyndsay‚
the rector of the benefice. On his promotion to be Archdeacon
of St. Andrews Sir William resigned the Ohuroh at Largs, 3rd
February, 1318, when the Chapter of the Oathedral, the See of
Glasgow being then vacant, before putting the monks in full
possessiones the Church, bound thern over to place in it a vicar
with a yearly stipend of seventeen merke sterling, six acres of

land and four wains of hay, to pay the procurations of the bishop
and to provide wax for the lights of the Ohurch.¹ In 1318, ’
Walter was appointed Governor of Berwick, and eight years after

was buried by the side of his wife Marjory. ln his quaint way,

Barbour tells how he was mourned.
