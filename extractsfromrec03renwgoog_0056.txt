INTRODUCI'ION. ll.

A reminiscence of the siege of Duchal occurs in the Iord High
Treasurer’s Accounts, where the following entry occurs: “ Item,
to the Larde of Hillus to ga to Payslay to get werkmen with
speidis and schwllis, J uly 22, 1489.”1 Two years later, in the dark
days of November, 1491, the King was again in Paisley. The
death of his father was still weighing heavy upon his heart. At
his own instance and at the instance of those who had been oon-
oerned in the crime, a petition had been sent to the Pope, and in
reply to it, Innocent VIII. had issued a Bull authorising the
Abbots of Paisley and J edburgh and the Chanoeflor of Glasgow
Oathedral to restore him and his co·petitioners to the communion
of the Church; and the King now carne to be absolved and to
make his peace with the Ohurch, and, if possible, with himself.²
What penances were appointed him is not known. He had then
been to Whithom on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Ninian.
Like the other great abbots, Abbot Shaw was a great builder,
and did much to improve the Monastery and its surroundings. He

built a refectory and other convontual buildings and surmounted
the principal gateway with a lolty tower. The churcb, the pre·
cincts of the convent, the gardens and a small decr park, be

enclosed with a wall about a mile in length, of excellent workman-
ship and adorned along its summit with statues, and on the north
side with three shields. The shield in the centre bore the royal
arms, that on the right the arms of the Stewards, and the other
the arms of the Abbot himself. At the angles of the wall were
curiously wrought niches, in one of which was a statue of St.
J ames the Apostle, and in another an image of the Virgin.
Undemeeth the latter was carved :—

Hac ue vade nisi dlxerir Ave Maria:
sit semper sine via, qui non tibi diost Ανο.ι
