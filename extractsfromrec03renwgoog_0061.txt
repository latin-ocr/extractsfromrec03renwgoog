lvi. THE BURGH OF PAISLEY.

and while the fair lasted goods and merchandise from France,
Flanders, Germany, England, and Ireland, as well as from other
parts of Sootland, might be seen exposed for sale upon the streets
or in booths erected for the purpose. Chapmen and packmen‚
whose interest it was to attend such gatherings, were there in
considerable numbers. J ugglers, acrobats, mountebanks, and
chariatans of all kinds drove their trade; friars and monks were

proceedings. The earliest record now extant is dated lOth Sep-

under date 8th April, 1606, it appears that there were then in
existence recorda of the proceedings of the Head (lourts going
