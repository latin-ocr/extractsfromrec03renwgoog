xcii. THE BURGH OF PAISLEY.

During his minority, the young Earl hed spent most of his time
in France and England‚ and the business of the family had been
managed by Marion Boyd, his mother, the first Countess of Aber-
corn, a woman of great energy and determination. In 1624, in 666
absence of her son, she presided over the Town Council, when met

for the electiones Bailies. Fora long time she bad conformed out·
wardly to the established religion, but all the time hed had strong

leanings towards the Catholic Choreb, and after her husband’s
death, in 1618, 666 made little attempt to hide them. Mr. Andro
Knox had long gone to the leleS, end the Protestants were fighting
among themselves, but the Presbytery of Paisley had not forgotten
how to persecute. Some of its earlier records are lost, but when
those which are extant take up the story on 2066 April, 1626, the
Presbytery is found “dealing'’ with James Stewart of Caversbank,
John Baillies and J ohnet his sponse, “ anent their not frequenting
the house of God for hearing the word of God preached end for not
communicating at occasionn offered,'’ and with two “ servitore to
666 Countess of Aberoorn,'' who, because they neither attended
preaching nor communicated with others of the congregation,
“gave just occasionn of their 'apostacie and defectioun from the
true religion,” etc.¹ F isteen days later a process was started
against the Countess herself—a proceeding of which she had
already 6666 warned by authority of the Synod and Assembly
held at Glasgow on the fourth of the preceding month.

The minister of the parish at the time was a relative of her

own, Mr. Robert Boyd of Toobrig, one of the best scholare of the
