INTRODUCTlON.

Dumna the Roman occupation of Great Britain what is now known
as the Oounty of Renfrew was inhabited by the Damnonii‚ a fierce
and warlike tribe related to the Dumnonii, who were then in pos-
session of Oornwall and Devon. They belonged to the first or
Goidelic immigration of the Oelts, and were thus unlike the rest
of the inhabitants of Strathclyde who belonged to the second or
Brythonio. Whether at the coming or during the time of the
Romans they hada settlement at Paisley is altogether uncertain.
The remains of military works said to have been in a fairly
good state of preservation down to the middle of the eighteenth lv*
century, show that the Romans had a station on Oakshawhead
with outpoets at Oastlehead and Woodside¹ The positione were

whole of the lower reaches of the Olyde. Vanduara‚¹ the name
which the Romans are supposed to have given to their station, is

'Chalmere was the first to suggest that Vanducra was the Roman nante for Paisley.
“flu masone are very incocclueive-viz., that there are said to have been Roman re·
mains at Pateley, eud that Vendusra is probably derived from the Weleh Gwendwr, or
White Water, and the river at Pateley is called tho White Cart. But rivere dc not change ¹
