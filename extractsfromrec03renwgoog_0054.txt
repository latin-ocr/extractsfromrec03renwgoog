populous place, while the presence of the Monastery and its s
increasing reputaticn as a resort for pilgrims were rapidly makings
Paisley a place of importance.

However gratifying all this might he to the Abbot and his
Convent to the neighbouring towns it was a cause of jealousy.
All of them, with one exception,¹ were Royal Burghs enjoying
numerous rights and privileges and possessed of considerable
power. Olose at hand was the Royal Burgh of Renfrew. To the
east was the ancient Royal Burgh of Rutherglen. To the west
were the Royal Burghs cf Ayr and Irvine; while close to the
Lennox part of the regality cf the Monastery was the Royal Burgh
of Dumbarton. Though often quarrelling among themselves as

burgh and throughout the barony. The charter also declares that
no markets were tc be held in the barony except within the burgh.

lived within the boundaries cf the barony. Whether the posses·
sion of a Oharter of Regality barred this, was a point they did
not stop to consider. For a century the magistrates cf Renfrew
had 'exercised what they believed to be their undoubted right,
