further, “ that twa hundred punds for the outreil( of ane troup
horse sall be imposted on the burgesses‚ heritors, and inhabitants
of the towne.” This “ troup horse ” was present on 3rd September,
1650, at the battle of Dunbar, which, in consequence of the
fanaticism of its ecclesiastical leaders, ended so disastrously for the
Scottish army.

Later on, under the guidence of its miniatem, the Town joined
the Remonstrants, whose headquarters were at Kilmarnock and
