Claud Hamilton there was no Provost. He and the two Earls of
Abercorn were called Provost or Lord Provost, but no Provost was
chosen by the Town Gouncil until 5th October, 1812. ln the
absence of Iord Claud, the Earl of Abercorn, aud the Master of
Paisley, the two Bailies presided over the Town Counoil. If one
of the Bailies was also absent, the other presided alone. From
the beginning, the custom appears to have been for the Abbot
Superior to appoint one of the Bailies and for the Town Oouncil
and community to elect the other. The second Earl of Abercorn

who had served in two successive years was ineligible for re-election
for a third year. The Town Oouncillors held office for a year,
and were eligible for re-eleotion. During their first year of office
they could be chosen Bailies, but in 1633 this was prohibited, and

viously served ou the Oouucil forat least a year.

The Town Council met once a fortnight, aud as osten as was
necessary. The Head Court met three times a year, after
