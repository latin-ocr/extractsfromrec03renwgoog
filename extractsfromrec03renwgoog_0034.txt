In or about the year 1245, the Priory was raised to the ls

dignity of an Abbey. Humbald had not long been gone from Ren-
frew, after exchanging his property there for Manwede, when it was
discovered that he had either purposely or negligently withheld
from the knowledge of Walter the fact that whoever was appointed
to rule the new foundation would have no power, according to the
rules of the Cluniae Benedictines, to receive regular professione or
to admit new members into the brotherhood. This, with other
matters which the “ Holy Humbald '' had neglected or otherwise
failed to make known, was felt to be a serious drawback and hurt-
ful to the prosperity of the House. Attempts were made to get
the rule relaxed, but the Abbot of Clugny refused to yield. He
demanded that the rulcs requiring reports to be constantly sent
from the House at Paisley to Clugny, and obliging every novioe to
attend personally at the latter place and there make his profession
before he could be admitted into the Order, should be strictly
observed, and would not in the least abate his prerogativae as head
of the Order. Accordingly King Alexander, doubtless prompted
by his oounsellor the Steward, applied to Pope Honorius ΙΙΙ.,
setting forth the loss the Convent had sustained through the want
of an Abbot, and how the monks had not been able to make
regular professione, “to the great danger of their souls, the de-
struction of order and the loss of their property,” and asking the
authority of his Holiness for the creation of an Abbot. In the
year 1219 Honorius appointed a commission to examine into the
matter, and empowered the Commissioners, if they thought proper,
to allow the monks to prooeed to the canonical election of an
Abbot in the Monastery. The Commissioners met at J edburgh,²
and summoned the Prior end Convent of Wenlock to appear before
