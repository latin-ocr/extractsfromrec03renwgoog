of gift and donation under the Great Seal, practically restoring
to him bis former estates and dignities. This letter was approved
and ratified by Parliament in the following year,l and, on the 29th
of J uly, 1587, he received a new charter of infestment, by which

’ he and hie heire and successore were put in possession of the

ancient properties of the Abbey‚ with certain exceptione which are
Ἢ specified. By the earne instrument, the temporalities of the Abbey
were erected into a temporal lordship‚ and Lord Claud was made
a lord of Parliament with the title of Lord Paisley. By the same
instrument alec, the King resigned the thirds and monks' portione
of the Monastery‚ all of which became the property of the
Hamiltons.²

The charter was executed between seven and eight o'clock in
the morning of the same day in which an Act of Parliament was
passed by which, with a few exceptione, all the Church lande within
the kingdom were annexed to the Crown,³ As will be seen on
referring to the charter, it was the intention to exclude the whole
of the lande of the Monastery of Paisley from the operations of
that Act, but, by some mistake‚ only the lande in the “ Toun ” of
Paisley were mentioned among the exemptione, and on the 5th
J une, 1592, an amending Act was passed by which the word
“ temporalitie '' was substituted for the word “ toun.”⁴ Thus, after
years of trouble and exile, “ stern Claud '' obtained once more the
lande and possessione of hie Commendatorship‚ and sat more
securely in them than he had done before,

Tho year after his return, Lord Claud took up his residence at
the Place of Paisley‚ and, when not abroad on political affairs, con-
tinued to reside there during the rest of hie life, watohing over
the intercete of the Burgh. Though he sided with the Protestant
party among the nobles and was in favour with the King, his
conduct was regarded by some ae not always above suspicion.
