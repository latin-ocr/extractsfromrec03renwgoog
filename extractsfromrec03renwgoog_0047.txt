xlii. THE BURGH OF PAISLEY.

sloth‚ and to set themselves to work to restore their fallen
discipline and to rekindle their decaying fervour so that they
might save their houses from the ruin that threatened them.'’l

The monks of Paisley were not without need of this royal
exhortation and warning. The Abbot at the time was Lithgow,
who, being now an old man, had for his coadjutor William de
Cheshclme. Before he was made Abbot, Oheshelme had acted
vigorously in defence of the Monastery, particularly in resist-
ing the demands of the vicars who served its churches for an
increase of their stipends. To some of thom the Oonvent had
been in the habitos giving doles over and above what it legally
owed them, and the Chapter authorised Oheshelme to try and
induce them to be contented with their bare legal stipenda, and,
in the event of his succeeding, gave him leave to keep what had
been paid in excess for his own use, in return for his trouble and
expense in negotiating the business, any statutas and customs of
their Order to the contrary notwithstanding. This was quite at
variance with their vows and the customs and statutos of their
Order, yet in 1388 they boldly and shamelessly set this whole
business down in their grant to Obeshelme, and affixed the soal
of the Chapter to it.² How long Cheshelme continued to be the
ruling spirit of the House is not known, but there can be little
doubt that at this time the condition of affairs in the monastery
was such as to justify the statement of the old Chronicler that
the place was “ out of all gude rewle.''⁸

Alter Cheshelme, Lithgow had for his coadjutor Thomas
Morwe. He is first heard of in 1418, when he received hom
Henry V. of England a safe conduct for himself and six oom-
panions to visit the King’s brother, John Duke of Bedford. The
passport wasto last hom 6th J uly to ard August.⁴ On the death
of John de LithgoW, in 1440, Morwe was still Abbot. Four years

later he was succeeded by Richard de Bodwell.
