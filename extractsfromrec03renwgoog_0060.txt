exclusive privilege of certain trades throughout the whole of
Perthshire. The monopoly of Inverkeithing extended over a
territory which included the burghs of Kinross, Burntisland,
Kinghorn‚ Kirkcaldy, and Dysart.¹ But the town of Paisley,

and to the burghal authorities often occupied the attention of Perliumant, and in the
town-lile ol the Middla Age· they plsyed an important part.
