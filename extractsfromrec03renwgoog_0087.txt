him to the more zealous and sour spirits of the Chureh, who
imagined‚ like the Dominicans iu Spain, that non-conformity could
be stamped out by imprisonment and fines and bitter persecution.
Soon after his settlement in Paisley, the most stringent measures
began to be used against those who did not conform. By his iron
rule a sort of outward conformity was obtained, but, as might be
expected, no good was done to religion. The Presbytery of
Paisley was not formed till the year 1590, and unfortunately its
extant records do not go further back than the year 1602. Among
other persone, the following were dealt with by the Presbytery
between the years 1602 and 1605 :-Maxwell of Stainlie, Ledy
Glencairn‚ Mr. Patrick WalkinshaW, Luke Stirling, John Logan
and Agnes Ralston of Baiae, J ean Knox Lady Duchal, John Knox
of Ranfurlie, Muir of Rowallan, Semple of Brintshields, and A.
Maxwell of Kilmacolm.¹ They did not all belong to the Parish of
Paisley, but as they were all cases of suspicion and non-conformity
which were judicially dealt with by the Presbytery of Paisley in
the course of little more than a couple of years, their number
alone is sufficient to show the spirit by which that reverend
body was animated. Lord Claud Hamilton was reported to
the General Assembly of 1588 as a receiver of J esuits, and his wife
was so distressed by the treatment she received at the hands of
Mr. Andro and his co-presbyters that she was almost driven to
despair and appealed to the King for protection against them.2
But all his own way Mr. Andro Knox did not get even in
Paisley. He was charged before the Privy Counoil with malicious
persecution and slander by John Gilchrist, the Reader and School-
master of the Town. Gilchrist’s complaint, which was also against
the Presbytery, ran that Knox‚ having conceived hatred and
malice against him, because he would not dispone to him his
lande of Boigsyd and sandisfurd, “ hes be all indirect meanis pro-
