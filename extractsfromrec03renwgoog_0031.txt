xxvi. THE BURGH OF PAISLEY.

to supply its wants¹ It has been said that the monks 01 Paisley
gave no encouragement to the growth and prosperity of the village
near which they were settled. The probabilities are 011 the other
way; as a matter of fact, indeed, when the foundation 01 the
Monastery took a practical shape‚ and as a consequence, Paisley
began to grow and prosper. The building 01 the Monastery would
occasion an influx of masona and of all manner 01 artificers. The
little village would at first be thrown into a state 01 0110110ωο01,
11111 111 a short time it would settle down 10 the serious work 01
making provision 101 110 increasing population and for meeting the ·
growing requirements 01 the Monastery. ,
Ι nster the arrival 01 the monks, the history 01 Paisley is

chapter house 01 Paisley.''¹

01 ground 101 the miller’s house, taking as annual rent only four
chalders 01 wheaten flour and four 01 grain. Five marks 01 silver,
which the convent of Mclrose used to pay him for his lands 01
Maphelim,⁸ he transferred to the monks 01 Paisley. He gave them
