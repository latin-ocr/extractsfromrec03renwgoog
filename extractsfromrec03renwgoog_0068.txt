INTRODUCTION. , lxiii.

Like his uncle, Abbot Robert appears to have been in great
favour with the King, and frequently received visits from him.
The first of the royal visits was paid in 1491. In 1507, the King
was accompanied by his Quaen, Margaret, daughter of Henry
VII. of England. Buildings were then in ¹progress at the Mones-
tery. The King inspectod them and gave “drink silver'’ to the
masons. Hs and his Queen were then making a pilgrimage to the
tomb of St. Ninian, at Whithorn. On their return they spent
eight days 11 the Monastery. During their stay the festival of
St. Anne occurred. They visited the altar founded in her honour,
and made various offerings. Among other gifts they gave a sum
of money 1ο Sir John Makbrek,¹ for distribution among the poor.

James was fond of music; perhaps because it soothed that
restlessness of mind that sent him to all parts of the country on
pilgrimages, and kept him perpetunlly moving from place to place.
Occasionally music gave place to plays. In August, 1489, the
Treasurer paid three pounds twelvc shillings “to Patrick Johnson
and his fallowis that playt a play to the King in Lythgow,”² and
in the same official's accounts for the following year we have the
entry ‘⁸ Item, on Fryda the xxiij J ulij, in Dunde, to the King to
gif the Fransche men that playt, xxo unicornis, xviij Ιὶ.”8 But
the payments in this connection are usually for “ harpers,”
“fithelaris,” and “lutaris'' Once a paymentof nine shillings is
made to “the hrokin backit⁴ fitular of Sanct Androis,” and there
are others “to the moddens of Forres that dansit to the King.”
In 1504, when the King was visiting Abbot Robert, the good
Abbot amused him neither with “dansing maddens” nor with a
“brokin backit fitular ; ’' but Iord Sempls, the Sheriff of the
Barony of RenfreW, brought his famous minstrel, John Haislet,
to the Abbey to entertain the King, and the following entry in
the Treasurer’s accounts occurs: “ 1504, Item, the last day of
