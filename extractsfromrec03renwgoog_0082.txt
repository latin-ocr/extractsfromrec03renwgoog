and gardens occupied by George Marshall and the office of
forester of the Wood of Monkshaw. His charter had been con-
firmed under the Great Seal. But Lord Semple‚ who, as we have
seen, was at one time Bailie of the Regality of Paisley, but had now
risen to be Commendamr, proposed to set Gilohrist's charter aside,
aud to confer the properties it secured to him upon his own nephew,
and was only restrained by a decreet of the Priwy Council for-
