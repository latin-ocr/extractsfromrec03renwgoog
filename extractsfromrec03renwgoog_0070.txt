Abbey of Paisley. The approval of the Pope was requisite for
both appointments, and over the appointment of Hamilton, who

“being of tendor age and bastard‚” His Holiness seems to have
hesitated. Anyh0w‚ the approval was long in coming, and Abbot
Robert and his friends grew alarmed at the delay. In May the
Abbot wrote to Wolsey, commending his “ loyal service’' both to

a thriving town, and, as we shall see further on, was gradually
extending its limite. For some time aster his appointment,
Hamilton left the management of the Abbey and Burgh to his
deputy, the Prior. In January‚ 1529, he seems to have oontem-
